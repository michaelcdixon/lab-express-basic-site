			Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which
			demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation
			and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were
			working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[55] In reality,
			Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for
			it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed
			Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course
			of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a
			minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was
			held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success
			and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as
			Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[56] and Gates took a leave of
			absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975.
			Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of
			"microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in
			Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high
			school collaborator Ric Weiland.[56] They dropped the hyphen within
			a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the
			Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[56] Gates
			never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's
			Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates
			discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being
			widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open
			Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that
			more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid
			Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of
			eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to
			produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[57] This
			letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates
			persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to
			demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976,
			and it continued to develop programming language software for
			various systems.[56] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue,
			Washington on January 1, 1979.[55] Gates said he personally reviewed
			and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in
			its first five years. As the company grew, he transitioned into a
			manager role, then an executive.[58] DONKEY.BAS, is a computer game
			written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS
			operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a
			driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. The
			game was written by Gates and Neil Konzen.

		<h2>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h2>

		<p>
			Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller,
			and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the
			"William H. Gates Foundation". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined
			three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5
			billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
			which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the
			world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly
			valued at more than $34.6 billion.[146][147] The foundation allows
			benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being
			spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the
			Wellcome Trust.[148][149] Gates, through his foundation, also
			donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University for a new building
			to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in
			2009.[150][151] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive
			philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and
			his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity
			work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic
			focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems
			that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[152] As of
			2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous
			philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to
			charity;[153] the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their
			wealth to charity.[154] The foundation is organized into five
			program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division,
			United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division. Among
			others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting
			aid to fight transmissible diseases such AIDS, tuberculosis and
			malaria, as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio.
			It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports
			scholarships at universities. The foundation established a water,
			sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation
			services in poor countries.[155] Its agriculture division supports
			the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice,
			a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A
			deficiency.[156] The goal of the foundation is to provide 120
			million women and girls, in the poorest countries, with high-quality
			contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of
			universal access to voluntary family planning.[157] In 2007, the Los
			Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in
			companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and
			pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[158]
			Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to
			assess social responsibility,[159] it was subsequently canceled and
			upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using
			voting rights to influence company practices.[160] Gates in a
			fireside chat moderated by Shereen Bhan virtually at the Singapore
			FinTech Festival 2020. Gates delivered his thoughts in a fireside
			chat moderated by journalist and news anchor Shereen Bhan virtually
			at the Singapore FinTech Festival on December 8, 2020, on the topic,
			"Building Infrastructure for Resilience: What the COVID-19 Response
			Can Teach Us About How to Scale Financial Inclusion".[161]
			Governments are there to think ahead to bad things that might
			happen. In the case of (the Covid-19) pandemic, not enough was done.
			We can't forget that another pandemic will come and we'll need to
			invest in being ready in that, ......while not forgetting that we
			were not prepared and we're going to have to invest - just like
			having a fire department - some money in an intelligent way and
			actually simulate what might happen and make sure that we're ready
			for it.[161] Gates favours the normalization of COVID-19 masks. In a
			November 2020 interview, he said: "What are these, like, nudists? I
			mean, you know, we ask you to wear pants, and no American says, or
			very few Americans say, that that's, like, some terrible thing."
