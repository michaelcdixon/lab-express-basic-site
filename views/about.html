			William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American
			business magnate, software developer, investor, author, and
			philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, along
			with his late childhood friend Paul Allen.[3][4] During his career
			at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive
			officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also
			being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[5] He is
			considered one of the best known entrepreneurs of the microcomputer
			revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Gates was born and raised in
			Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in
			Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal
			computer software company.[6][a] Gates led the company as chairman
			and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by
			Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors
			and became chief software architect.[9] During the late 1990s, he
			was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered
			anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court
			rulings.[10] In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at
			Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
			the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife, Melinda
			Gates, established in 2000.[11] He stepped down as chairman of the
			board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as
			technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya
			Nadella.[12] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at
			Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic
			efforts including climate change, global health and development, and
			education.[13] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes
			list of the world's wealthiest people.[14][15] From 1995 to 2017, he
			held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year
			except from 2010 to 2013.[16] In October 2017, he was surpassed by
			Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of
			US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at
			the time.[17] As of May 2021, Gates had an estimated net worth of
			US$144 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in the
			world.[18] Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day
			operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and
			philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several
			companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, bgC3, and TerraPower.
			He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable
			organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill &
			Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private
			charity.[19] Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century
			vaccination campaign which significantly contributed to the
			eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa.[20][21] In 2010, Gates
			and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other
			billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to
			philanthropy.[22]
